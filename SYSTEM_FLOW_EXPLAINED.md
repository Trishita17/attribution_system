# How the Multi-Agent Attribution System Works (Simple Explanation)

## üéØ **What Happens When a User Makes a Request**

### **Example: User asks "How did customer cust_001 convert?"**

```
User Request ‚Üí API Server ‚Üí Agent Manager ‚Üí Agents ‚Üí Database ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Response
```

## üîÑ **Step-by-Step Flow**

### **1. API Server (Front Door)**
- **What it does**: Receives the user's request
- **Like**: A receptionist at a company
- **Example**: User calls `GET /comprehensive-insights/cust_001`
- **Action**: "Someone wants to know about customer cust_001, let me route this"

### **2. Agent Manager (Coordinator)**  
- **What it does**: Decides which agents to use and coordinates them
- **Like**: A project manager assigning tasks to team members
- **Action**: "I need the Search Agent and Display Agent to work together on this"

### **3. Search Agent (Search Expert)**
- **What it does**: Analyzes customer's search behavior
- **Like**: A search marketing specialist
- **Steps**:
  1. Connects to Snowflake database
  2. Pulls customer's search history (finds 9 search queries)
  3. Asks AI: "What do these searches tell us about intent?"
  4. Calculates: "Search contributed 64.3% to the conversion"

### **4. Display Agent (Display Expert)**
- **What it does**: Analyzes customer's display ad interactions  
- **Like**: A display advertising specialist
- **Steps**:
  1. Connects to Snowflake database
  2. Pulls customer's ad impressions (finds 5 display ads)
  3. Asks AI: "How effective were these ads?"
  4. Calculates: "Display contributed 35.7% to the conversion"

### **5. Snowflake Client (Data Fetcher)**
- **What it does**: Gets data from your database
- **Like**: A librarian finding specific books
- **Action**: "Here are all the search queries and ad impressions for cust_001"

### **6. LLM Client (AI Brain)**
- **What it does**: Analyzes data using artificial intelligence
- **Like**: A smart analyst who can understand patterns
- **Examples**:
  - "This search query shows high purchase intent"
  - "This ad creative performed well"
  - "Customer is in the decision stage"

### **7. Response Assembly**
- **What happens**: All agents combine their findings
- **Like**: Team members presenting their findings to the manager
- **Result**: Complete customer analysis with recommendations

## üé≠ **Real Example Walkthrough**

### **User Request**: `GET /comprehensive-insights/cust_001`

**1. API Server**: "Got a request for customer cust_001 insights"

**2. Agent Manager**: "I'll coordinate Search and Display agents"

**3. Search Agent**:
   - Queries database: "Give me cust_001's search history"
   - Finds: 9 search queries like "gaming headphones", "best gaming headphones"
   - Asks AI: "What's the intent here?"
   - AI responds: "High purchase intent, comparison shopping"
   - Calculates: "Search gets 64.3% attribution weight"

**4. Display Agent**:
   - Queries database: "Give me cust_001's ad impressions" 
   - Finds: 5 display ads (banners, videos)
   - Asks AI: "How did these perform?"
   - AI responds: "Good engagement, video ads worked well"
   - Calculates: "Display gets 35.7% attribution weight"

**5. Agent Manager**: "Combine both analyses"

**6. API Server**: Returns complete analysis:
```json
{
  "search_contribution": "64.3%",
  "display_contribution": "35.7%", 
  "recommendations": ["Increase search budget", "Optimize video ads"],
  "customer_journey": "9 searches + 5 ad views"
}
```

## üß† **What Each Component Actually Does**

### **API Server** (`api_server.py`)
- **Job**: Handle web requests
- **Like**: Restaurant waiter taking orders
- **Does**: Routes requests, returns responses

### **Agent Manager** (`agent_manager.py`)  
- **Job**: Coordinate multiple agents

### **Display Agent** (`display_agents.py`)
- **Job**: Understand display ad performance

### **Snowflake Client** (`snowflake_client.py`)
- **Job**: Get data from database
- **Like**: Data warehouse worker
- **Does**: Runs SQL queries, returns customer data

### **LLM Client** (`llm/client.py`)
- **Job**: AI-powered analysis
- **Like**: Smart consultant
- **Does**: Interprets data, provides insights, makes recommendations

## üéØ **Simple Analogy: Like a Consulting Team**

**User Question**: "Why did this customer buy from us?"

**API Server** = **Receptionist**: Takes the question, routes to right team

**Agent Manager** = **Project Manager**: "I need our search expert and display expert"

**Search Agent** = **Search Consultant**: "Let me check their Google searches... they searched 9 times, very interested in gaming headphones"

**Display Agent** = **Display Consultant**: "Let me check the ads they saw... 5 different ads, the video ones worked best"

**Database** = **Filing Cabinet**: Contains all the customer data

**AI** = **Smart Analyst**: "Based on the patterns, search was more important (64%) than display (36%)"

**Final Report**: "Customer converted because of strong search intent (64%) supported by effective display ads (36%). Recommend increasing search budget."

## üîç **Why This Approach Works**

1. **Specialization**: Each agent is expert in their channel
2. **Coordination**: Manager ensures they work together  
3. **AI-Powered**: Smart analysis of patterns humans might miss
4. **Real Data**: Uses your actual customer behavior from Snowflake
5. **Actionable**: Provides specific recommendations, not just numbers

**In simple terms: It's like having a team of marketing experts analyze your customer data with AI assistance to tell you exactly how each marketing channel contributed to sales.**
