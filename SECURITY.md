# Security Guidelines

## Environment Configuration

### Credentials Management
- **Never commit** `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables
- Store sensitive credentials in secure environment variable systems
- Rotate API keys and database passwords regularly

### Snowflake Security
- Use **external browser authentication** when possible (SSO)
- Implement **least privilege access** - grant only necessary permissions
- Enable **network policies** to restrict access by IP
- Use **private keys** instead of passwords for production environments

### API Security
- Implement **rate limiting** on all endpoints
- Use **HTTPS only** in production
- Add **API key authentication** for external access
- Validate and sanitize all input parameters

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling
- **Mask customer IDs** in logs and debug output
- **Encrypt data at rest** in Snowflake
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Audit data access** and maintain access logs

### Privacy Compliance
- Implement **data retention policies**
- Support **data deletion requests** (GDPR compliance)
- **Anonymize or pseudonymize** customer data where possible
- Document **data processing purposes** and legal basis

## Production Deployment

### Infrastructure Security
- Use **container scanning** for vulnerabilities
- Implement **network segmentation** between services
- Enable **logging and monitoring** for security events
- Regular **security updates** for dependencies

### Access Control
- **Multi-factor authentication** for admin access
- **Role-based permissions** for different user types
- **Regular access reviews** and deprovisioning
- **Secure backup** and recovery procedures

## Development Security

### Code Security
- **Dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities
- **Static code analysis** for security issues
- **Secret scanning** in CI/CD pipelines
- **Security testing** in development workflow

### Best Practices
- **Input validation** on all user inputs
- **Error handling** without information disclosure
- **Secure logging** practices (no sensitive data in logs)
- **Regular security training** for development team

## Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- **Automated alerts** for suspicious activities
- **Log aggregation** and analysis
- **Performance monitoring** for DoS detection
- **Regular security assessments**

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate containment** of security incidents
2. **Impact assessment** and stakeholder notification
3. **Evidence preservation** for forensic analysis
4. **Recovery procedures** and service restoration
5. **Post-incident review** and improvement planning

## Compliance Requirements

### Data Governance
- **Data classification** and handling procedures
- **Retention and disposal** policies
- **Cross-border data transfer** compliance
- **Third-party data sharing** agreements

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- **SOX** compliance for financial data
- **Industry-specific** regulations as applicable
